/**
 *  TealiumCollect is the main class for the Tealium Collect Library.  
 *
 *  This defines the public API for sending & receiving data through collect and by default audience stream
 *
 *  Currently it is entirely exposed via class methods.  This is done to allow flexabilitiy of changing the implementation.  Currently it is implemented using a singleton instance of the library and sending messages to it's instance methods.
 *  Internally the entire library runs inside its own serial queue so there is no need call TealiumCollect methods from a background thread, it takes care of that on its own.
